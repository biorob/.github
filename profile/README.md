**We work on the computational aspects of locomotion control, sensorimotor coordination, and learning in animals and robots.**

The Biorobotics Laboratory (BioRob in short) is part of the [Institute of Bioengineering](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bioengineering/) in the [School of Engineering](https://sti.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland üá®üá≠. 
We are interested in using robots and numerical simulation to study **the neural mechanisms underlying movement control and learning in animals**. 
We draw inspiration from animals **to design new control methods in robotics and develop novel robots capable of agile locomotion in complex environments**. 
We are also interested in **rehabilitation robotics, e.g., exoskeletons, and in restoring locomotion**.

Our research interests thus lie at the intersection of robotics, computational neuroscience, biomechanics, nonlinear dynamical systems, and machine learning. 

We carry out research projects in the following areas: 
* Neuromechanical simulations of locomotion and movement control
* Systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators for locomotion control
* Design and control of amphibious, legged, and reconfigurable robots
* Control of humanoid robots and exoskeletons.
